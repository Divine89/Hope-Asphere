## Packages
date-fns | Date manipulation and formatting for bookings
react-day-picker | Calendar components for selecting booking dates
framer-motion | Smooth animations and page transitions

## Notes
- We are using Replit Auth; `useAuth` is assumed to be at `@/hooks/use-auth` and login is handled via `/api/login` and `/api/logout`.
- Wouter handles routing. Wouter's `<Link>` shouldn't wrap `<a>` tags.
- The theme is clean, minimal, professional startup.
